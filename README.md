# FITS Image Analysis Project

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project performs analysis on astronomical FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) images using [mention your tools, e.g., Python, Astropy, NumPy, etc.]. It is designed to [briefly explain the main goal â€“ e.g., extract features, generate plots, detect objects, etc.].

## ðŸ›  Features

- Load and parse FITS files
- Image preprocessing (e.g., normalization, cropping, noise filtering)
- Analysis functions (e.g., photometry, object detection, histogram analysis)
- Visualization (matplotlib-based display of FITS images and results)
- CLI or GUI support (if applicable)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
